Online Bookstore Inventory Management System

Overview:
Create a back end system for an online bookstore where users can browse, search, and purchase books. The system should efficiently manage the bookstore's inventory, handle user authentication, and process orders.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement user authentication and authorization to allow users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

2. Book Inventory Management:
   - Store information about books including title, author, genre, ISBN, publication date, price, and quantity available.
   - Implement data structures to efficiently manage the book inventory, such as hash tables, binary search trees, or graphs depending on the requirements.
   - Allow administrators to add, update, delete, and search for books in the inventory.

3. Shopping Cart Functionality:
   - Allow users to add books to their shopping cart, update quantities, and remove items.
   - Implement algorithms for managing the shopping cart efficiently, such as linked lists or arrays.

4. Order Processing:
   - Implement algorithms for processing orders, such as sorting algorithms to organize orders by date or priority.
   - Handle payment processing and order confirmation.

5. Search and Filtering:
   - Enable users to search for books based on title, author, genre, or other criteria.
   - Implement efficient search algorithms, such as binary search or hash-based search.

6. Data Persistence:
   - Use a database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store user profiles, book inventory, shopping carts, and order history.
   - Design an efficient database schema to support the application's requirements and optimize database queries.

7. Security Measures:
   - Implement security measures such as encryption for sensitive user data and secure communication protocols (HTTPS).
   - Protect against common security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

8. API Design:
   - Design RESTful APIs for interaction with the backend services.
   - Document the APIs using OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) or similar tools.

Additional Considerations:

- Scalability: Design the system to handle a growing number of users and a large inventory of books.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging to troubleshoot issues and improve system reliability.
- Performance Optimization: Optimize algorithms and data structures for efficient resource utilization and response times.
- Testing: Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation for developers, administrators, and end-users on how to use the system and troubleshoot common issues.
